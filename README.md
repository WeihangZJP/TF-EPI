# TF-EPI
TF-EPI: An Interpretable Enhancer Promoter Interaction Detection Method Based on Large Language Model

# What is TF-EPI?
The detection of enhancer-promoter interactions (EPI) is crucial for understanding gene expression regulation, disease mechanisms, and more. In this study, we developed TF-EPI, a deep learning model based on transformer technology, designed to detect these interactions solely from DNA sequences.
